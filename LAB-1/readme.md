# 🧩 Maze Solver using BFS & DFS

This project demonstrates how to solve a **grid-based maze** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms in Python. It showcases the power of classical AI search strategies to find paths in a 2D maze environment.

## 🎯 Objective

🔍 Implement BFS and DFS to explore and solve a maze efficiently.  
🎯 Identify the shortest path from a **start cell** to an **end cell**.  
🧱 Use `0` to represent **walls** and `1` for **walkable paths**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

> Given a 2D grid maze where:  
> - `0` = Wall (Not Traversable)  
> - `1` = Open Path (Traversable)  
> Find a valid path (or the shortest one) between two points using **BFS** and **DFS**.

🧠 Algorithms Used
🔵 Breadth-First Search (BFS): Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

🔴 Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible before backtracking.

## 📌 Applications

- Game AI pathfinding
- Robot navigation
- Puzzle-solving bots
- Grid-based simulations
